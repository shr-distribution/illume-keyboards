This documentation is regarding the Dutch virtual terminal keyboard for Illume
which is packaged in illume-keyboard-terminal-dutch-nl.

When this package is installed, the file Terminal.kbd will be temporarily hidden
as _Terminal.kbd_. Deinstalling this package will restore Terminal.kbd.

The file Terminal-dutch-nl.kdb has been created out of Terminal.kbd with the
following changes:
- added icons for page up, page down, home, end and caps lock and a negative
  version of caps lock
- used these and existing icons in minimal dimensions to maximise the number of
  available keys
- mapped *all* possible characters used in the Dutch language according to
 http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenttekens_in_de_Nederlandse_spelling#Frequentie
  with the most used in the normal view, less used in shift view and exotic ones
  in caps lock view
- no capitals with diacritics are offered, except for Aring, because these are
  not used in the Dutch language
- added euro symbol
- added ssharp for better German support
- added ij-digraph and IJ-digraph, see
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(orthography)#Double_letters
  for now they result in 'i'+'j' and 'I'+'J'
- moved backspace and enter key down to create more space
- moved insert and delete to easy use of delete by moving it away from the edge
- renamed 'ctrl' to 'ctr', this is also three characters like 'alt', which
  aligns it better inside the key
- key output in between " will be used in combination with dictionary, for Dutch
  extra keys are "-" and "'" wich occur a lot inside words.

The file qwerty-dutch-nl.png has been created out of qwerty.png with the
following changes:
- the Dutch flag with colours which were picked from
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg has been used as
  background, see http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Illume#List_of_illume_keyboards

TODO:
- incorporated this package into enlightement svn and build process and have
  this reflected in the CONTROL/control file and offload the extra icons like
  page up etcetera to the illume package
