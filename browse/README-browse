This documentation is regarding the finger friendly browse virtual keyboard for
Illume which is packaged in illume-keyboard-browse.

The file browse.png has been created manually with Inkscape and GIMP according
to http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Illume#List_of_illume_keyboards

TODO:
- incorporated this package into enlightement svn and build process and have
  this reflected in the CONTROL/control file and offload the extra icons like
  page up etcetera to the illume package
- set fuzzy in .kbd file?
- keyboard type is set to NONE, is this the best choice?
