This documentation is regarding the numeric alternative virtual keyboard for
Illume which is packaged in illume-keyboard-numeric-alt.

When this package is installed, the file Numeric.kbd will be temporarily hidden
as _Numeric.kbd_. Deinstalling this package will restore Numeric.kbd.

The file Numeric-alt.kdb has been created out of Terminal.kbd and Numeric.kbd
with the following changes:
- larger and more finger friendly keys
- more navigation keys
- removed keys with currency symbols and characters with diacritics that don't
  belong in numeric keyboard
- shift mode and caps lock mode which are not needed and took up space have been
  removed
- faster in usage because shift and caps lock are not there and all keys are
  directly available

The file numeric-alt.png has been created manually with Inkscape and GIMP
according to http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Illume#List_of_illume_keyboards

TODO:
- incorporated this package into enlightement svn and build process and have
  this reflected in the CONTROL/control file and offload the extra icons like
  page up etcetera to the illume package
- set fuzzy in .kbd file?
